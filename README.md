# IoT-temperature-humidity-monitor
IoT system using Raspberry Pi and DHT22 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity. 

## Project Overview
This project is an Internet of Things (IoT) system developed as part of a team project for an IoT course. The system uses a Raspberry Pi and DHT22 sensor to monitor environmental temperature and humidity in real time.

## Objectives
- Design and implement an IoT-based monitoring solution
- Collect and display real-time sensor data
- Demonstrate understanding of IoT architecture and embedded systems

## Technologies Used
- Raspberry Pi 4
- DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Python
- GPIO
- IoT Architecture

## Project Documentation
- Project Proposal
- Abstract and References
- Final Written Report
- Class Presentation

## System Description
The DHT22 sensor is connected to the Raspberry Pi via GPIO pins. A Python script reads temperature and humidity data and displays the output through the terminal.

## Results
The system successfully captured real-time environmental data and demonstrated a functional IoT monitoring solution suitable for smart home or environmental applications.

## Future Improvements
- Cloud data storage (AWS / Firebase)
- Web dashboard
- Data visualization
- Security enhancements
